      " The Scroll of Sealing?!\n",
      " Let's see…\n",
      " The first Jutsu is… Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\n",
      " What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?\n",
      " Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him!\n",
      " This is not just a prank!\n",
      " The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\n",
      " Depending on its use…\n",
      " It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\n",
      " Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\n",
      " Yes, sir!\n",
      " Where did you go…Naruto?\n",
      " I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto…\n",
      " Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\n",
      " Hey you, Naruto!\n",
      " You found me..\n",
      " And I've only learned one Jutsu.\n",
      " He's been practicing the Jutsu…\n",
      " until he's become this exhausted and dirty…?\n",
      " Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\n",
      " You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\n",
      " Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\n",
      " Who told you that?\n",
      " Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place…\n",
      " Mizuki did?!\n",
      " I'm impressed you found this place.\n",
      " I see now…how it is.\n",
      " Naruto, give me that scroll.\n",
      " Wait, wait… What's going on here?\n",
      " Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\n",
      " It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\n",
      " Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\n",
      " W-Wha--?\n",
      " Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\n",
      " Huh?\n",
      " What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto!\n",
      " I will tell you the truth.\n",
      " Idiot! Don't do that!\n",
      " After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\n",
      " A rule?\n",
      " That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\n",
      " Except me?! \t\t\t\t\tWhat is it?\n",
      " Stop it, Mizuki!\n",
      " The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\n",
      " Huh?\n",
      " You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\n",
      " who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village!\n",
      " Stop it!\n",
      " Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\n",
      " Didn't you find it strange?\n",
      " Why everyone hated you so much?\n",
      " No! No! No! No! No!\n",
      " Naruto…\n",
      " Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much!\n",
      " Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\n",
      " Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\n",
      " That's why he keeps misbehaving.\n",
      " It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\n",
      " He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\n",
      " Die, Naruto!\n",
      " Naruto! \t\t\t\t\tGet down!\n",
      " Why…?\n",
      " Because you and I are the same.\n",
      " After my parents died,\n",
      " nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\n",
      " I wasn't a good student in school.\n",
      " I was the class clown… because I wanted people to notice me.\n",
      " I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\n",
      " It was so hard.\n",
      " Isn't that right, Naruto?\n",
      " You felt so lonely…right? And you suffered inside, right?\n",
      " I'm sorry, Naruto….\n",
      " If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.\n",
      " Don't make me laugh!\n",
      " Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\n",
      " He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\n",
      " Naruto!\n",
      " Narutoooooo!\n",
      " He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\n",
      " He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\n",
      " Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\n",
      " No… Naruto…isn't…like that at all!\n",
      " All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\n",
      " I'll take care of you later!\n",
      " I-I won't let you…\n",
      " Well, well.\n",
      " Mizuki has a big mouth!\n",
      " Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.\n",
      " He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\n",
      " The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\n",
      " There's a slight chance he might actually release\n",
      " the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\n",
      " If that happens…\n",
      " I've found him!\n",
      " Naruto!\n",
      " Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\n",
      " Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\n",
      " It can't be…\n",
      " Why is it, Naruto?\n",
      " How…\n",
      " did you know I wasn't Iruka…?\n",
      " Because I'm Iruka.\n",
      " I see.\n",
      " What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\n",
      " I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\n",
      " You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\n",
      " Same?\n",
      " Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\n",
      " There is no way that that monster…\n",
      " that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll!\n",
      " You're right…\n",
      " I guess it was true all along!\n",
      " See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\n",
      " ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\n",
      " But Naruto is different!\n",
      " I know that he is an exceptional student.\n",
      " He works very hard,\n",
      " and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\n",
      " No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\n",
      " He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\n",
      " He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\n",
      " You are so gullible. \t\t\t\t\tlruka!\n",
      " I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\n",
      " Die!\n",
      " I guess this is the end for me…\n",
      " Naruto?!\n",
      " You surprised me there, freak.\n",
      " If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\n",
      " Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\n",
      " Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!\n",
      " Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\n",

      " Yeah.\n",
